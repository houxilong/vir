### IC10 Attribute

Subclass of: **E36 Visual Item**

**E29 Design or Procedure**

A set of features considered by a viewer more salient than others and used as a key for the identification of a Representation. The attribute could correspond to iconographical elements or simple signs which the viewer uses to provide a stable identity to a visual object.

**Example:**

	- The cross in the Anastasia Samaralina painting in Asinou that symbolize the Martyrdom.
	- The dragon in "Saint George and the Dragon" by Tintoretto.

### IC12 Visual Recognition

Subclass of: **S4 Observation**

The activity of assigning the iconographical status to a man-made
object, or to one of its parts. It takes into account the possibility to
link it to a speech act or a document where the authoritative
proposition is clearly made.

**Example**:

	- An expert saying that object A is a IC9 Representation
	- The recognition that a simple drawing represents a type of animal

#### Proprieties:
+ [K9 assigned status to (has status assigned by)]: E18 Physical Thing
+ [K11 assigned (was assigned by)]: [IC9 Representation]

### IC16 Character

Subclass of: **F38 Character**

This class comprises fictional individuals, or groups, appearing in a
representation. Each character portrayed can have a type, for example "Saint" or "layman". Every saint portrayed is considered here as a character and not as an actor.

	- The photographer's stamp in the verso of the photograph of St. John the Baptist by Vicino da Ferrara

#### Proprieties:

+ [K6 has front (has back)]: [IC19 Recto]
+ [K8 is verso of (has verso)]: E22 Man-Made Object
